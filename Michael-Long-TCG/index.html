      <strong>I'm passionate about AI for card games. </strong>I'm actively <a style="color: black" href="https://1drv.ms/w/s!AgGaayakKbuqqT9XNS_grXupYwLD?e=P7URsv" target="_blank">researching AI techniques and capabilities</a>  to enhance the Pokémon TCG experience.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <strong>I love building things.</strong> Besides constructing Pokémon decks, I maintain multiple aquariums, including an indoor pond with an aquaponics filtration system. I also developed Politicize, a website predicting political affiliation, and I'm currently working on a Pokémon TCG tournament simulator.
    </li>
    <li style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
      <strong>I have a strong analytical background.</strong> I spearheaded ESG and consumer behavior projects at <a style="color: black;" href="https://www.ulyssesmgmt.com/#about" target="blank">Ulysses</a>, listening and adapting to market demand signals. At <a style="color: black;" href="https://www.desautelscapital.ca/" target="_blank">Desautels Capital Management</a>, I utilized quantitative trading skills/modelling to analyze and identify unique investments opportunities.

    <h2 class="title" style="text-align:center">See my vision for the Pokémon TCG and PTCG Live</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">I believe PTCG Live should be the best place for Pokémon TCG online, uniting players worldwide and catering to all skill levels. Drawing from my experience as a PTCG Live user and insights gathered from discussions with prominent players, here are potential projects to enhance the platform:</p>
    <div class="flex-container">
      <div class="flex-item selected">
        <div class="neutral-background">
          <h3 class="title" style="text-align:center">Game Vault</h3>
          <p>
            Rewatch and save past matches! Users could analyze their gameplay and share their favorite moments with friends. The vault could also feature famous matches from the past accompanied by expert commentary.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Increased user engagement by offering a platform for sharing and learning from others' experiences. This feature could complement the forthcoming battle log: users could simply click on a log to immediately locate and relive pivotal moments in their games.</p>
          <p><strong>Implementation:</strong> Developing a method for saving + accessing matches, with an initial focus on uploading famous games, such as the 2015 US National Finals and the 2014 World Championships Finals, to captivate users and showcase the vault's functionality.</p>

            <strong>Implementation:</strong> Leveraging PTCG Live's existing infrastructure to gather data from high-level matches and initially deploying simple game heuristics for decision-making. As we progress and collect more match data, adding advanced technologies like neural networks will further enhance the AI trainer's capabilities.
